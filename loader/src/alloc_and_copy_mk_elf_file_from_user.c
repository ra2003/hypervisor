/**
 * <!-- description -->
 *   @brief When the start VMM function is executed, the user must provide
 *     the address and size of the microkernel ELF file to be loaded and
 *     executed. This ELF file exists in user-space memory and cannot be
 *     directly accessed. As a result, we must copy this array from user
 *     space into a array in the kernel where the loader exists. This
 *     function performs this copy by first allocating a array the size
 *     of the ELF file being copied and then copies the contents to this
 *     newly allocated array. For this reason, once this ELF file is no
 *     longer needed, you must free the ELF file as memory was previously
 *     allocated.
 *
 * <!-- inputs/outputs -->
 *   @param mk_elf_file_from_user the ELF file to copy
 *   @param copied_mk_elf_file where to copy the ELF file too
 *   @return 0 on success, LOADER_FAILURE on failure.
