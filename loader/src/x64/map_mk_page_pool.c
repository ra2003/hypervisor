/**
 * <!-- description -->
 *   @brief This function maps the microkernel's page pool into the
 *     microkernel's root page tables.
 *
 *   @note Unlike other map functions, this function needs to set up the
 *     direct map. This is because the only part of the direct map the
 *     microkernel needs is the page pool. What this means is each page
 *     is mapped to the direct map base address (virt), with the
 *     physical address added (i.e., to get the physical address of a
 *     page from the page pool, just take it's virtual address and
 *     subtract virt). Then, the first 64 bits of the page store the
 *     address of the next page in the page pool (using the direct map
 *     address). This way, all we need to do is pass virt to the
 *     microkernel, and it will have the HEAD of a linked list of pages
 *     that can be used as a page pool.
 *
 * <!-- inputs/outputs -->
 *   @param page_pool a pointer to a mutable_span_t that stores the page pool
 *     being mapped
 *   @param base_virt provide the base virtual address that the page pool
 *     should be mapped to.
 *   @param pml4t the root page table to map the page pool into
 *   @return 0 on success, LOADER_FAILURE on failure.
